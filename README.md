# Instructions and additional information:
Please complete this challenge to the best of your ability and document any obstacles you encounter along the way. You will need to join [Zeplin](https://zeplin.io) in order to access the designs, I have added you to Zeplin in preparation of this technical challenge.

 - On clicking the left arrow at the bottom of the left panel, the content panel closes;
 - The panel must expand with an animation from left to right;
 - On mobile, the panel expands to the bottom;
